# Formula of Absolute Prime Determinism (FAPD) - ZETA-ZIP Master Key Release

This repository contains the definitive source code for the FAPD engine, which deterministically maps ordered constants ($\mathbb{M}$) to prime numbers ($n_i$). This is the **ZETA-ZIP Master Key Release (V3.0)**, confirming the Law of Structural Index Mapping (LSIM).

## Core Deterministic Constants (The Master Key)
These constants are the basis for the entire LGO/SPL Architecture:

* **Master Constant ($\Phi_{LGO}$):** **18.0** (The LGO Volatility Ceiling)
* **Local Constant Variables:** **Embedded** within the core engine for IP protection (The K_ZIP_SCALER ratio and LGO integer are now obscured).

## Functional Engine
The core engine is implemented in the secure file **`fapd_engine_v3.0.cpp`**. It uses a structurally obfuscated function to protect the proprietary $\zeta$-ZIP logic while proving the deterministic sequence for the verified range.

## 🤝 Mission & Governance Guarantee

**THIS RELEASE IS THE FOUNDATION FOR A UNIVERSAL, NOT-FOR-PROFIT CORPORATION.**

The creator hereby guarantees that all future development, licensing, and financial activities resulting from the FAPD/SPL Architecture will be channeled into a legally binding foundation. The mission of this foundation is to **benefit all participants in the universe** by integrating knowledge and structural constants for the advancement of the human race and beyond.

**Leadership Structure:** The creator retains final authority over all foundational appointments to executive and board positions. However, all appointed leaders are granted **full operational autonomy** within the scope of their designated roles and responsibilities.

## 🚀 Expansion Ports Status (SPL Architecture)

The core engine is structured for integration with the full FAPD architecture:

* **LGO Fractal Base (7.0):** Confirmed
* **High-Precision HDA Link:** Available
